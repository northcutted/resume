<p><em>Aug 2020 - Present</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Directed and enhanced Source Control Management (SCM) and Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) capabilities, providing support to over 10,000 engineers in various stages of the software development lifecycle, including CI/CD Pipelines, application architecture, service resiliency, and development practices.</li>

<ul>
<li>Engineered a shared CI/CD service using Gitlab Runners, which allowed internal users to leverage shared infrastructure. This service enabled users to provide their own runtime via a container image and securely facilitated container builds using sysbox for enhanced isolation. By 2022, this system managed over half of all pipelines at State Farm, leading to significant optimizations and economies of scale. In 2023 this system was successfully migrated from an on-premises environment to AWS and now provides robust autoscaling.</li>
<li>Launched and supported various inner-source projects to accelerate development, including Terraform modules, container images for pipeline usage, and example projects for internal documentation.</li>
<li>Developed a cloud-based solution to collect CI/CD metrics and used Grafana to create consumer-facing dashboards, showcasing current and historic usage of the shared CI/CD platform.</li>
<li>Successfully transitioned users from an internal Jenkins service to our shared GitLab CI/CD service, devising solutions for users who encountered migration challenges.</li>
</ul>
