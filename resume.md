## Objective
Seasoned Lead Software Engineer with a robust background in DevOps, specializing in CI/CD processes and cloud-based solution design. Proven track record in managing large-scale, on-premises enterprise environments, optimizing software processes, and enhancing system efficiency. Eager to leverage my technical leadership and DevOps expertise to drive operational excellence in a challenging role.

## Work Experience
**Lead Software Engineer, State Farm**  
*Aug 2020 - Present*

**Responsibilities:**
- Oversaw and improved SCM and CI/CD capabilities, supporting over 10,000 engineers in various aspects of the software development lifecycle, including CI/CD Pipelines, application architecture, service resiliency, and development practices.
- Implemented Agile workflows and collaborated with product teams to actualize future enhancement visions.
- Created and delivered educational materials for internal users.
- Provided mentorship to peers.

**Achievements:**
- Designed and implemented a shared CI/CD service using Gitlab Runners, enabling internal users to utilize shared infrastructure. This service facilitated users in providing their own runtime via a container image and securely enabled container builds using sysbox for enhanced isolation. By 2022, this system managed over half of all pipelines at State Farm, allowing for significant optimizations and economies of scale. Additionally, migrated this system from an on-premises environment to AWS.
- Initiated and supported various inner-source projects to expedite development, including Terraform modules, container images for pipeline usage, and example projects for internal documentation.
- Devised a cloud-based solution to gather CI/CD metrics and utilized Grafana to create consumer-facing dashboards, displaying current and historic usage of the shared CI/CD platform.
- Successfully transitioned users from an internal Jenkins service to our shared GitLab CI/CD service, devising solutions for users who faced migration challenges.

**Software Developer, State Farm**  
*June 2018 - Aug 2020*

**Responsibilities:**
